Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is a portable, event-drive runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

It's hard to become a distributed systems expert, nor should you have to. Developers want to focus on business logic, while leaning on the platforms to imbue their applications with scale, resiliency, maintainability, elasticity and other attributes of cloud-native architectures.

This is where Dapr comes in. Dapr codifies the *best practices* for building microservice applications into open, independent APIs called building blocks, that enable you to build portable applications with the language and framework of your choice. Each building block is completely independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.

Dapr is platform agnostic, meaning you can run your applications locally, on any Kubernetes cluster, on virtual or physical machines and in other hosting environments that Dapr integrates with. This enables you to build microservice applications that can run on the cloud and edge.
